		<p>Founded as a school for the instruction of Shotokan Karate, students also have the opportunity to learn from masters in Jiu-Jitsu, Iaido, and take part in specific self-defense courses derived from these arts.</p>
		<p>Shotokan Karate is a school promoted by the teachings of Gichin Funakoshi, who is widely credited with the proliferation of Karate-do throughout Japan and the world. Justice Karate American Shotokan blends distinctly American martial techniques with Shotokan Karate. Since 1972 this synthesis has resulted in an award winning and practical style.</p>
